            The Parish at Our Lady of Sorrows was established in 1887. A few
            years later, on June 21, 1891, the parish dedicated their first
            school on Academy Street. An important feature of the new school was
            a “first class hall” over the classrooms, for the holding of parish
            fairs and entertainments. The Bulletin of the time commended local
            Catholics “for their spirit of enterprise and independence in
            arranging to erect a hall for the purpose of holding their
            entertainments.”

            To the Editor of the Bulletin the parish auditorium pointed up the
            fact that “this village is at present without any well appointed
            public hall, and that so long as it does not possess that which is a
            feature and pride of every well regulated and enterprising
            community, South Orange will be voted slow and behind the times….”
          </p>

            For nearly 120 years, Our Lady of Sorrows School has served the
            community of South Orange. From the invention of the automobile to
            the invention of the Segway, OLS has thrived on the “spirit of
            enterprise” first noted in the Bulletin of 1891.

            The Great Depression, two World Wars, Ike, JFK, the Eagle landing on
            the moon, Vietnam, Watergate, Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush
            again, and now Obama: OLS has been there through it all. And always
            with the same mission: to provide quality education and guidance for
            the children entrusted to its care. Literally thousands of students
            have passed through its doors on the way to outstanding high
            schools, colleges, and careers.

            Our Pre-K, Kindergarten, and Grade School are well-known for
            fostering academic achievement, service, and the three R’s: Respect
            for yourself, Respect for others, and Responsibility for your
            actions.

            Now, recognizing the need in our community for quality infant and
            toddler care for working parents, once again, this “spirit of
            enterprise” is alive in the OLS family. The Nursery, an infant and
            toddler child care center, will open in the former Convent on the
            campus of Our Lady of Sorrows School. This historic building,
            constructed in 1926, has been painstakingly restored and modernized.
            The homey atmosphere of the former residence combines with state of
            the art computer technology to create a new-fashioned center with
            old-fashioned values.
