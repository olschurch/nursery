        <h2>Infant Care</h2>
        The Nursery wants to be partners with you the parent. You are trusting
        us with your baby and we want to earn that trust. Our child care infant
        program provides a loving and nurturing environment for 6-week to
        12-month-old children. This full-time program allows staff to help
        children develop a sense of security with their environment. In the
        Infant room each child has an Individual Plan. We believe that you as
        parents should be the people making the decisions about your baby’s day
        at The Nursery. Whether your baby eats or sleeps on a schedule or on
        demand, we will support your decision and follow your directives.
        Teamwork between home and the infant room is vitally important. The
        needs of infants are ever changing, which means communication among
        adults is essential to support each child’s care and education. From
        birth, babies are learning at an amazing rate. They are investigating
        sights, sounds, and textures. At The Nursery we provide a rich
        environment full of opportunities to actively explore and master their
        world. They are surrounded with attentive caregivers who respond to
        their needs, fill their day with responsive interactions and language,
        and give each baby the nurturing so important to develop a sense of
        trust. Our infants are read to, held, played with, challenged and loved
        throughout their day. Reaching, grasping, kicking, holding, pulling,
        creeping, crawling are all encouraged with the younger infants. Older
        infants work on walking, feeding, gripping, throwing, climbing, pushing
        and pulling. All babies explore texture, color, patterns, size, shape,
        taste and weight. Cognitively they learn object permanence, spatial
        relationships, cause and effect and problem solving. Through adult-child
        conversations, reading, fingerplays, songs and music the infants are
        immersed in a language rich environment. Infants explore art, movement,
        pretend play and role playing. Each infant is provided with their own
        crib or cot depending on their age and readiness. At feeding time, the
        younger babies are always held when having a bottle. When they are ready
        for solid food we have small, individual high chairs to encourage
        self-feeding skills. When parents decide that their child is ready for
        finger food, The Nursery provides nutritious snacks and food is sent in
        from home to assure continuity of feeding and food choices. We provide
        gentle care to meet the daily needs of diapering, feeding, and sleeping.
        By earnestly working to meet the infant’s basic needs, we create a
        healthy and safe environment. We believe diaper time is a time for
        wonderful interactions with the infant. The caregivers view this as a
        special one on one time when they can spend time talking with the babies
        and further developing a sense of trust. Each family provides the
        diapers, wipes and ointments that they wish to be used. Every infant is
        changed at least every two hours or more often if needed. Although you
        are away from your child during the day, you will know what their day
        was like through the daily report you will receive at the end of each
        day. This report lets you know about diaper changes, feeding, naps and
        notes about what your baby did while at The Nursery. The daily report
        supplements the conversations you will have with the caregivers each
        day. Our caregivers try to always be available either at drop off or
        pick up times and can be called anytime during the day.

        <h2>Toddler Care</h2>
        Toddlers are beginning to control their world. They are asking the
        adults in their world to “help them do it all by myself”. During this
        wonderful time they are developing many self help skills including
        feeding themselves, using the toilet, dressing themselves, drinking from
        a cup, etc.. Our toddler sized child care environment removes many of
        the obstacles to learning these skills. At The Nursery our tables and
        chair, cubbies, cots and shelves are designed for toddlers. Our toilets
        and sinks are child sized, not adult sized with stools. Many of our
        learning activities focus on skills needed to manipulate buttons,
        zippers and snaps. Our toddlers are encouraged to try to put on their
        own coats, shoes, socks and clothing. We believe that through patience
        and breaking tasks into small steps most toddlers can learn appropriate
        independence. . A consistent program of developmentally appropriate
        activities helps to nurture a positive “can-do” attitude. The toddler
        room is full of materials that promote further language development.
        There are alphabet and phonic activities, early math materials. The
        toddlers experience art through many mediums including crayons, markers,
        paint, finger-paint, clay, etc. Our art activities are child directed
        allowing the child to develop actual skills and experience art mediums
        on their own as opposed to learning to copy an adult made prototype.
        Small and large motor skills are improved and refined throughout the
        program. Many manipulatives such as large legos, link-its, and puzzles
        are always available for the toddlers to chose. Movement activities take
        place through scarf play, circle time, balls and fingerplays, all of
        which help develop the child’s large motor skills. Our playground is
        equipped with age-appropriate equipment allowing the toddlers to climb,
        jump, slide, run and ride. Weather permitting the toddlers go outside at
        least twice each day. In the toddler room, snack and lunch are served as
        a group activity. Each day there will be a morning and afternoon snack,
        provided by The Nursery. The children can either bring their own lunch
        or lunch can be ordered at an additional fee from the elementary school.
        Snack and lunch times are special opportunities for the toddlers to
        learn social skills and manners. The children learn to set the tables,
        sit nicely and clean up when they are done eating. Naptime is in the
        early afternoon shortly after lunch. Each child is provided a
        toddler-sized cot. Families are encouraged to send in a blanket and
        small pillow if desired. The caregivers turn off the lights and play
        quiet music to help the children rest. The caregivers are happy to rub
        backs to help the toddlers to fall asleep. No child is forced to sleep.
        After resting on their cot for thirty minutes, a child who does not
        sleep is allowed to choose a quiet activity until naptime is over.
